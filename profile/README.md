# Welcome to the Building Performance Simulation Community!

## üè† Purpose

A place for community discussion ___and___ development of BPS topics and tools*.

## üèóÔ∏è Discussion

Why another chat platform when there's already a Slack workspace (UnmetHours) and Discord server (The Modeling Gang)? 

Neither is based on an [open source standard](https://matrix.org/faq/#what-is-matrix) or has [end-to-end encryption](https://matrix.org/faq/#encryption). 
Furthermore, the existing UnmetHours Slack workspace has a limit of 10k searchable messages, which Gitter and Matrix do not.
Join the discussions on https://gitter.im/ and/or https://matrix.org/ with the links below.

### [Gitter](https://gitter.im/BuildingPerformanceSimulation/) [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/BuildingPerformanceSimulation/](https://badges.gitter.im/BuildingPerformanceSimulation/.svg)](https://gitter.im/BuildingPerformanceSimulation/?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

Gitter rooms are connected to the repositories here and are for development-focused discussions related to the resepective repository. 
These rooms are [bridged to Matrix](https://matrix.org/bridges/#gitter) for those that prefer to use a [Matrix client](https://matrix.org/clients/) for ___both___ development and general discussions (more on that below).
Note that Gitter requires logging in with a GitHub, GitLab, or Twitter account.

### [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/!iUhfZAniiNyVtVFPvY:matrix.org?via=matrix.org) 

Not a developer? Don't have a GitHub, GitLab, or Twitter account? 

The Building Performance Simulation space on Matrix is the place to start, which contains the bridged Gitter repository rooms ___and___ general discussion rooms.

Discussion Topic | Example Room Name
:- | :-
Tool development | `BuildingPerformanceSimulation/<repository>`
General | `openstudio`

## üè≠ Development

Have an idea for a tool, but don't see it ‚§µÔ∏è? Start a discussion ‚§¥Ô∏è.

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
üåà Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
üë©‚Äçüíª Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
üçø Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
üßô Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
