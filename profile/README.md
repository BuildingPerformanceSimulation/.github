# The Building Performance Simulation Community

## Purpose

Welcome to the Building Performance Simulation GitHub organization! A place for community discussion and development of BPS*.

## Discussion

Join the discussions on https://gitter.im/ and/or https://matrix.org/ with the links below.

### [Gitter](https://gitter.im/BuildingPerformanceSimulation/) [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/BuildingPerformanceSimulation/](https://badges.gitter.im/BuildingPerformanceSimulation/.svg)](https://gitter.im/BuildingPerformanceSimulation/?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

Gitter rooms are connected to the repositories here and are for development-focused discussions related to the resepective repository. 
These rooms are [bridged to Matrix](https://matrix.org/bridges/#gitter) for those that prefer to use a [Matrix client](https://matrix.org/clients/) for _both_ development and general discussions (more on that below).
Note that Gitter requires logging in with a GitHub, GitLab, or Twitter account.

### [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/!iUhfZAniiNyVtVFPvY:matrix.org?via=matrix.org) 

Not a developer? Don't have a GitHub, GitLab, or Twitter account? 
The Building Performance Simulation space on Matrix is the place to start, which contains the bridged Gitter repository rooms _and_ general discussion rooms.

Discussion Topic | Example Room Name
:- | :-
Tool development | `BuildingPerformanceSimulation/<repository>`
General | `openstudio`
